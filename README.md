# Notes:
# - Book Code can be removed if it's same as BookId and not what I think as coding method for books like B0010, C0052 and etc.
# - In filters I used price as a way to demonstrate filtering by integer instead of publish year cause there was no field with that name, Usually for price there should be a range filter not exact value.
